## Google Summer of Code 2017

I was lucky enough to participate in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) in 2017. I was working with my mentor, and all-round hip cat [Shashi Gowda](https://github.com/shashi), on creating a new version of the [Julia](https://julialang.org) package [Interact.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGizmos/Interact.jl).

The new version, which has the working title [InteractNext](https://github.com/JuliaGizmos/InteractNext.jl), is built on top of Shashi's cool new [WebIO](https://github.com/JuliaGizmos/WebIO.jl) and [Vue.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGizmos/Vue.jl) packages.

Like Interact.jl, it enables building simple UIs for interactive data exploration, with widgets such as sliders, toggle buttons, text boxes, etc., however, while Interact is only available in IJulia, InteractNext supports Atom/Juno, Blink, Mux, as well as IJulia, and it shouldn't be too hard to add support anywhere html/js/css can be displayed from Julia - the Julia VSCode extension could be next on the supported list.

I had a good time, got a bit done - despite (because of?) it not actually being summer down here in Australia - and generally am glad I got involved. I most enjoyed having what felt like privileged access to some of my open source heroes in the Julia community, such as Shashi, and [Mike Innes](https://github.com/mikeinnes), among others.

### Acknowledgements

I'd like to thank my mentor Shashi, not just for his help during GSoC, but for his visionary work on great Julia packages such as Reactive, Interact, Observables, WebIO, and Vue (among others!).

Also want to shout out to Julia's creators, supporters, and contributors, this Julia thing is building...

Finally, it'd be remiss if I didn't tip my hat to those at Google supporting Open Source in general, and in particular those pushing the GSoC itself, which seems to me, to be a force for good.
